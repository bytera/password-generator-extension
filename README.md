# Password Generator Chrome Extension
There are two motivations behind developing this password generator.
1. Understand how to develop a Chrome Extension.
2. Develop a password generator with higher degree of customizability compared to Chrome's native password manager.

Most of the code was inspired by Proton's [password generator](https://proton.me/pass/password-generator).

## Add the Extension to Chrome
1. Clone the repository.
2. Visit `chrome://extensions`.
3. Click on `Load unpacked` and select the repository.

## Improvements
- Add styling to user interface.
- Add options for passphrase.
- Allow custom keyword or keyphrase.
- Interact with Chrome's password manager to store the generated password automatically.
